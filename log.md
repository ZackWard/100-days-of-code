# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, July 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I refactored a few test cases for my Book Trading app so that they're less brittle

**Thoughts** I have really enjoyed working with Async/await so far. And, I'm not going to elaborate too much, because I'm getting this log entry in right under the deadline tonight. :)

### Day 2: Wednesday, July 19th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued to refactor tests. Implemented cancel/decline trade request functionality.

**Thoughts**: After I finish refactoring these tests, I should be able to run any test in isolation, and to run the tests in any order. Hopefully I should be finished with the API soon, and can begin working on the front end.

### Day 3: Thursday, July 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued to refactor tests.... again. 

**Thoughts**: Slow progress today, and once again finishing the hour of coding right under the deadline. Typing this at 11:51. I seem to get more done when I can do my hour of coding earlier in the day.
