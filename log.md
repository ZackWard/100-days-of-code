# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, July 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I refactored a few test cases for my Book Trading app so that they're less brittle

**Thoughts** I have really enjoyed working with Async/await so far. And, I'm not going to elaborate too much, because I'm getting this log entry in right under the deadline tonight. :)
